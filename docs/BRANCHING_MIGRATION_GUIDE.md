## Overview

### What's Changing?

**Before** (Traditional Multi-Branch):
```
master         (production code)
development    (development code)
testing        (test code)
staging        (staging code)
production     (production code - duplicate?)
```
**Total long-lived branches**: 5

**After** (Modified GitHub Flow):
```
main           (production releases, tagged)
develop        (integration, latest features)
feature/*      (temporary, deleted after merge)
fix/*          (temporary, deleted after merge)
hotfix/*       (temporary, emergency fixes)
```
**Total long-lived branches**: 2

### Why Migrate?

✅ **Simpler**: 2 branches instead of 5
✅ **Faster**: Fewer merge steps
✅ **Clearer**: Each branch has distinct purpose
✅ **Modern**: Industry standard 2025 approach
✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions
✅ **Less confusion**: No duplicate branches (master/production)

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario A: Fresh Start (No Existing Branches)

**Situation**: New repository or can afford to start fresh

**Steps**:
1. Create `main` branch
2. Create `develop` from `main`
3. Configure branch protection
4. Start using new strategy

**Time**: 15 minutes
**Risk**: None
**Recommended for**: New projects, solo developers

---

### Scenario B: Minimal Migration (Keep Main, Add Develop)

**Situation**: Have `main` or `master` branch with history you want to keep

**Steps**:
1. Rename `master` to `main` (if needed)
2. Create `develop` from `main`
3. Delete old branches (development, testing, staging, production)
4. Configure branch protection
5. Update documentation

**Time**: 30 minutes
**Risk**: Low
**Recommended for**: Most projects

---

### Scenario C: Full Migration (Preserve All History)

**Situation**: Multiple active branches with work in progress, need to preserve everything

**Steps**:
1. Identify source of truth branch
2. Consolidate branches
3. Create clean main/develop structure
4. Migrate feature branches
5. Archive old branches (don't delete)
6. Configure branch protection

**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Medium
**Recommended for**: Large teams, complex history

---

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Phase 1: Preparation (Do This First!)

#### 1.1 Backup Repository

```bash
# Clone fresh copy as backup
cd ~/backups
git clone --mirror https://github.com/yourusername/misp-install.git misp-install-backup
cd misp-install-backup

# Verify all branches exist
git branch -a

# This is your safety net - don't delete!
```

#### 1.2 Document Current State

```bash
# In your working repository
cd ~/misp-install/misp-install

# List all branches
git branch -a > /tmp/branches-before-migration.txt

# Show branch relationships
git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate > /tmp/git-history-before.txt

# List current tags
git tag > /tmp/tags-before-migration.txt
```

#### 1.3 Communicate with Team

Send this message to your team:

```
Subject: Git Branching Strategy Migration - [DATE]

Hi team,

We're migrating to a new branching strategy on [DATE] at [TIME].

BEFORE migration:
- master, development, testing, staging, production branches

AFTER migration:
- main (production releases)
- develop (integration)
- feature/* (temporary branches)

What you need to do:
1. Commit and push all in-progress work by [DEADLINE]
2. After migration, pull latest changes
3. Read new branching guide: docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md

Migration will take approximately 1 hour.
Repository will remain accessible (no downtime).

Questions? Reply to this email.
```

---

### Phase 2: Identify Source of Truth

**Key Question**: Which branch contains your production code?

#### Scenario A: master/main is production

```bash
git checkout master  # or main
git log --oneline -5

# Is this your latest stable code? YES → This is your source of truth
```

#### Scenario B: production branch is production

```bash
git checkout production
git log --oneline -5

# Is this your latest deployed code? YES → This is your source of truth
```

#### Scenario C: Unsure / Branches diverged

```bash
# Compare branches
git diff master..production
git diff master..development

# Check tags (usually on production branch)
git tag --list
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph | head -50

# Find latest release tag
git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)

# Find which branch has that tag
git branch --contains [TAG]
```

**Decision**: Choose the branch with:
1. Latest release tag
2. Most recent production deployment
3. Code currently in use by users

---

### Phase 3: Create New Branch Structure

#### 3.1 Rename master to main (if needed)

```bash
# If you have 'master' branch, rename to 'main'
git checkout master
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main

# Update default branch on GitHub
# GitHub > Settings > Branches > Default branch → main

# Tell collaborators to update their local repos:
# git branch -m master main
# git fetch origin
# git branch -u origin/main main
```

#### 3.2 Ensure main has latest production code

```bash
git checkout main

# If production branch has newer code, merge it
git merge production --no-ff -m "chore: merge production into main for migration"

# Or if you want to replace main with production
git reset --hard production
git push --force origin main  # ⚠️ Use with caution!
```

#### 3.3 Create develop branch

```bash
# Option A: Create develop from current main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# Option B: If development branch exists and has valuable work
git checkout main
git merge development --no-ff -m "chore: merge development into main for migration"
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

---

### Phase 4: Migrate In-Progress Work

#### 4.1 List all feature branches

```bash
git branch -a | grep -E "(feature|feat|fix|bug)" > /tmp/feature-branches.txt
cat /tmp/feature-branches.txt
```

#### 4.2 Rebase feature branches onto develop

```bash
# For each feature branch:
git checkout old-feature-branch

# Rebase onto develop
git rebase develop

# Rename to new naming convention
git branch -m old-feature-branch feature/descriptive-name

# Push to remote (may need force push if rebased)
git push -u origin feature/descriptive-name

# Delete old remote branch
git push origin --delete old-feature-branch
```

**Example**:
```bash
# Old: "my-cool-feature"
git checkout my-cool-feature
git rebase develop
git branch -m my-cool-feature feature/ssl-certificates
git push -u origin feature/ssl-certificates
git push origin --delete my-cool-feature
```

---

### Phase 5: Archive Old Branches

**Don't delete immediately** - archive for reference

#### 5.1 Tag old branches for archive

```bash
# Tag each old branch before deleting
git tag archive/development development
git tag archive/testing testing
git tag archive/staging staging
git tag archive/production production

# Push tags to remote
git push origin --tags
```

#### 5.2 Delete old branches locally

```bash
# Delete local branches (safe - tags preserved)
git branch -D development testing staging production

# Verify tags exist
git tag | grep archive/
```

#### 5.3 Delete old remote branches (optional - wait a week first)

```bash
# After team confirms no issues (wait 1 week):
git push origin --delete development
git push origin --delete testing
git push origin --delete staging
git push origin --delete production

# Tags remain, can be restored if needed
```

---

### Phase 6: Configure Branch Protection

Use one of these methods:

#### Method A: Automated (GitHub CLI)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already
# sudo apt install gh
# gh auth login

# Run setup script
./setup-branch-protection.sh
```

#### Method B: Manual (Web Interface)

Follow [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)

---

### Phase 7: Update Documentation

#### 7.1 Update README.md

Add this section near the top:

```markdown
## Branching Strategy

This project uses **Modified GitHub Flow**:

- `main` - Production releases (protected, tagged)
- `develop` - Integration branch (latest features)
- `feature/*` - New features (temporary)
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes (temporary)
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes (temporary)

See [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for complete guide.

Quick reference: [BRANCHING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](development/BRANCHING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
```

#### 7.2 Update CONTRIBUTING.md (if exists)

```markdown
## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from develop:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. Make changes, commit, push

3. Create pull request to develop

4. After review and CI pass, merge

See [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for details.
```

#### 7.3 Add branching documentation

Files already created:
- ✅ `docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md` (30+ pages)
- ✅ `BRANCHING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (2 pages)
- ✅ `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` (this guide)

## Rollback Plan

**If migration fails**, here's how to recover:

### Emergency Rollback (Within 24 hours)

```bash
# 1. Restore from backup
cd ~/backups/misp-install-backup
git push --mirror https://github.com/yourusername/misp-install.git

# 2. Force update local repos
cd ~/misp-install/misp-install
git fetch origin --force
git reset --hard origin/master  # or your old main branch

# 3. Notify team
# "Migration rolled back, return to old workflow"
```

### Partial Rollback (Restore specific branch)

```bash
# Restore from tag archive
git checkout -b development archive/development
git push -u origin development

# Or restore from backup
cd ~/backups/misp-install-backup
git push origin development:development
```

### Restore Deleted Branch

```bash
# If you have the tag
git checkout -b old-branch-name archive/old-branch-name
git push -u origin old-branch-name

# If no tag, find in reflog (within 90 days)
git reflog show --all | grep "branch-name"
git checkout -b restored-branch [SHA]
git push -u origin restored-branch
```

## FAQ

### Q: What if my team is still using old branches?

**A**: Gradual migration:

1. Keep old branches temporarily
2. Create main/develop alongside them
3. New work goes in new structure
4. Old work finishes on old branches
5. After 2-4 weeks, delete old branches when empty

### Q: How do I handle merge conflicts during migration?

**A**:

```bash
# When merging branches during migration
git merge other-branch

# If conflicts:
git status  # See conflicting files
# Edit files, resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "chore: resolve migration conflicts"
```

### Q: Can I keep my old branch names (master instead of main)?

**A**: Yes, but not recommended:

- `master` is legacy naming
- `main` is modern standard (GitHub default since 2020)
- Most new repos use `main`
- Easy to rename: `git branch -m master main`

### Q: What if I have release branches (release/v5.4.0)?

**A**: These fit the new strategy!

- Keep using release branches if needed
- They're temporary (deleted after merge)
- See docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md for release workflow

### Q: Should I delete development branch immediately?

**A**: No, archive first:

```bash
# 1. Tag for archive (safe)
git tag archive/development development
git push origin archive/development

# 2. Wait 1 week

# 3. Then delete (can restore from tag if needed)
git push origin --delete development
```

### Q: How do I handle pull requests to old branches?

**A**: Retarget them:

1. Go to PR on GitHub
2. Click "Edit" next to branch names
3. Change base branch from `development` to `develop`
4. Update, save

### Q: What if migration breaks our deployment pipeline?

**A**: Update deployment config:

```yaml
# Old deploy config
if branch == "production":
    deploy_to_prod()

# New deploy config
if branch == "main" and has_tag:
    deploy_to_prod()
```
