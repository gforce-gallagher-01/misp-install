  - Added to main installation flow between Phase 11 and Phase 12
- üîß **API Helper Module** - Centralized API access for all scripts
  - Created `misp_api.py` with functions: `get_api_key()`, `get_misp_url()`, `get_misp_client()`, `test_connection()`
  - Auto-detects API key from .env, PASSWORDS.txt, or environment variable
  - SSL verification disabled for self-signed certs
  - Test mode available (`python3 misp_api.py`)
- üì° **API-Based Scripts** - New scripts using MISP REST API instead of database
  - `scripts/add-nerc-cip-news-feeds-api.py` (v2.0) - Add feeds via `/feeds/add` API ‚úÖ Working

### Changed
- **Installation Flow** - Added Phase 11.5 for automatic API key generation
- **Script Architecture** - Migrated from direct database access to MISP REST API where possible (85% complete)
  - 2 scripts fully converted to API (add-nerc-cip-news-feeds, check-misp-feeds)
  - 1 script partially working (populate-misp-news - upstream API issue)
  - 1 script keeps database approach (configure-misp-nerc-cip - uses proper cake commands)
- **GUI Installer** - Configuration files now compatible with `misp-install.py --config`

### Fixed
- **API Integration** - Worked around broken `/news/add` endpoint by keeping database version as fallback
- **Feed Management** - Duplicate detection via API prevents adding same feed twice
- **GUI Clipboard** - Fixed clipboard paste support with xclip dependency

### Security
- **API Keys** - Secure storage in PASSWORDS.txt and .env with 600 permissions
- **No Database Passwords in Scripts** - API-based scripts don't need MySQL credentials
- **RBAC Enforcement** - API calls respect MISP role-based access control

### Known Issues
- **MISP /news/add API** - Returns HTTP 500 (upstream issue) - using database version as workaround
- **GUI Installer** - Requires pipx on Ubuntu 24.04+ or manual pip installation

## [5.4.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- üîí **ACL-based Permission System** - Implemented Linux Access Control Lists for multi-user log directory access
  - Replaces world-writable (777) permissions with granular user-specific ACLs
  - Supports Docker containers (www-data), misp-owner, and installation user writing to logs simultaneously
  - Critical ACL mask fix ensures rwx permissions are effective
  - Config files (.env, PASSWORDS.txt, docker-compose files) now have read ACLs for backup scripts
  - Backup/restore scripts can now run as regular user without sudo for file reads
- üì¶ **ACL Package** - Added `acl` package to system dependencies (Phase 1)
- üìù **Enhanced Documentation** - Complete ACL implementation documented in:
  - SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md - ACL security model and architecture
  - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - ACL permission troubleshooting guide
  - MAINTENANCE.md - ACL management and verification procedures
  - ACL-FIX-SUMMARY.md - Complete technical implementation details

### Changed
- **Phase 10.6**: Completely rewritten to use ACL-based permissions instead of chmod 777
  - Multi-step ACL configuration for existing files
  - Default ACL configuration for newly created files
  - ACL mask correction to enable write permissions
  - Config file ACLs for backup script access
- **Backup Scripts**: Now work as regular user without root privileges (thanks to config file ACLs)
- **Permission Model**: Updated file ownership matrix to reflect ACL permissions

### Fixed
- **Log Permission Conflicts**: Solved Docker's forceful ownership reset of `/opt/misp/logs` to www-data:www-data
  - Previous chmod 777 approach was reset by Docker on container restart
  - ACL solution persists across Docker restarts while respecting upstream behavior
- **Backup Permission Errors**: Fixed `PermissionError` when backup scripts tried to read config files owned by misp-owner
- **Effective Permissions**: Fixed ACL mask issue where effective permissions were r-x instead of rwx

### Security
- **More Secure Than 777**: ACLs grant access only to specific users, not all system users
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each user/process has only the permissions it needs
- **Respects Docker Ownership**: No modifications to upstream MISP Docker images required
- **Audit Trail**: ACLs provide clear visibility into which users have access to which files

sudo apt install python3.8 python3-pip

# 3. Download v5.4
wget https://github.com/gforce-gallagher-01/misp-install/releases/download/v5.4.0/misp-install.py

# 4. Optional: Install PyYAML for YAML config support
pip3 install pyyaml

# 5. Run new installer
python3 misp-install.py

# Or migrate your old config to new format
# See docs/UPGRADE.md for details
```
