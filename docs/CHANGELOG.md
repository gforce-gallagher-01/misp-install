## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 4.x to 5.0

**Breaking Changes:**
1. **Python Required:** Now requires Python 3.8+ instead of pure Bash
2. **Config Format:** New config file format (see `config/` directory)
3. **Directory Structure:** Some files reorganized

**Migration Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Backup your current installation
bash backup-misp.py  # If you have v4.x script

# 2. Install Python 3.8+ if needed
sudo apt install python3.8 python3-pip

# 3. Download v5.0
wget https://github.com/gforce-gallagher-01/misp-install/releases/download/v5.0.0/misp-install.py

# 4. Optional: Install PyYAML for YAML config support
pip3 install pyyaml

# 5. Run new installer
python3 misp-install.py

# Or migrate your old config to new format
# See docs/UPGRADE.md for details
```

**What Stays the Same:**
- MISP container structure
- Database location
- SSL certificates
- Backup files
- `/etc/hosts` configuration

**What Changes:**
- Installation script (Python instead of Bash)
- Config file format (YAML/JSON with more options)
