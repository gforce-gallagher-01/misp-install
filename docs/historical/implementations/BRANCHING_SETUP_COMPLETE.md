# Branching Strategy Setup Complete ✅

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **READY TO PUSH**
**Strategy**: Modified GitHub Flow (main + develop)

---

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Step 1: Set Up `develop` Branch

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Actions Taken**:
```bash
# Created develop branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b develop
```

**Result**:
- ✅ `main` branch exists (current production code)
- ✅ `develop` branch created (identical to main initially)
- ✅ Both branches ready for push

---

### ✅ Step 2: Branch Protection Configuration

**Status**: READY (Tools Created)

**Files Created**:

1. **setup-branch-protection.sh** (Automated)
   - GitHub CLI script for automated setup
   - Configures both main and develop branches
   - Takes ~30 seconds to run
   - Location: `./setup-branch-protection.sh`

2. **docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md** (Manual Guide)
   - 30+ page comprehensive guide
   - Step-by-step web interface instructions
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Best practices for different team sizes

**Protection Rules Defined**:

**`main` branch (Strict)**:
- ✅ Requires pull request with 1 approval
- ✅ Requires CI checks to pass (validate, test)
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- ✅ Require conversation resolution
- 🚫 No force pushes
- 🚫 No branch deletion
- ✅ Includes administrators

**`develop` branch (Moderate)**:
- ✅ Requires CI checks to pass (validate, test)
- 🚫 No force pushes
- 🚫 No branch deletion
- ℹ️ Pull request reviews optional (faster iteration)

**How to Apply**:

**Option A**: Automated (after pushing to GitHub)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
sudo apt install gh
gh auth login

# Run automated setup
./setup-branch-protection.sh
```

**Option B**: Manual (via web interface)
```
Follow: docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md
Time: 10-15 minutes
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Migration Guide

**Status**: COMPLETE

**File Created**: `docs/BRANCHING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (40+ pages)

**Contents**:
- ✅ 3 migration scenarios (fresh start, minimal, full)
- ✅ 8-phase step-by-step process
- ✅ Backup and rollback procedures
- ✅ Team communication templates
- ✅ Validation checklist
- ✅ Timeline example (1-2 hours)
- ✅ FAQ with 10+ common questions

**Migration Options**:

**Scenario A: Fresh Start** (Your Situation)
- Time: 15 minutes
- Complexity: Low
- You're here! Just push main and develop

**Scenario B: Minimal Migration**
- Time: 30 minutes
- For existing repos with simple structure

**Scenario C: Full Migration**
- Time: 1-2 hours
- For complex repos with many active branches

---

## Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Push Branches to GitHub (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Push main branch
git checkout main
git push -u origin main

# Push develop branch
git checkout develop
git push -u origin develop
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Both branches appear on GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI triggers on first push
- ✅ Default branch set (likely main or develop)

---

### 2. Set Up Branch Protection (REQUIRED)

**Choose one method**:

**Option A: Automated** (Recommended if you can install GitHub CLI)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
# Follow prompts to authenticate

# Run automated setup
./setup-branch-protection.sh
# Takes ~30 seconds, configures both branches

# Verify
# Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/misp-install/settings/branches
```

**Option B: Manual** (If GitHub CLI not available)
```bash
# Open browser to:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/misp-install/settings/branches

# Follow step-by-step guide:
cat docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md
# Or view on GitHub after pushing

# Time: 10-15 minutes total
```

---

### 3. Set Default Branch (OPTIONAL)

**Recommendation**: Set `develop` as default branch

**Why**: Pull requests default to develop (integration), not main (production)

**How**:
```
GitHub → Settings → Branches → Default branch
Switch from: main
To: develop
Click: Update
Confirm
```

**Result**: New PRs default to develop instead of main

---

### 4. Update README (RECOMMENDED)

Add branching strategy section to README.md:

```markdown
## Branching Strategy

This project uses **Modified GitHub Flow**:

- `main` - Production releases (protected, tagged: v5.4.0, v5.5.0)
- `develop` - Integration branch (latest features)
- `feature/*` - New features (temporary, short-lived)
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes (temporary)
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

**Guides**:
- Complete guide: [docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)
- Quick reference: [BRANCHING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](BRANCHING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- Migration guide: [docs/BRANCHING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](docs/BRANCHING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

**CI/CD**:
- All PRs automatically tested (syntax, lint, security, tests)
- CI runs on Python 3.8-3.12
- See: [docs/CI_CD_GUIDE.md](docs/CI_CD_GUIDE.md)
```

---

### 5. Test the Workflow (RECOMMENDED)

Create a test pull request to verify everything works:

```bash
# Create test feature branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/test-workflow

# Make trivial change
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "test: verify branching workflow"

# Push
git push -u origin feature/test-workflow

# Create PR on GitHub
# - Base: develop
# - Compare: feature/test-workflow
# - Verify: CI runs automatically
# - After CI passes: Merge
# - Delete feature branch
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ PR created successfully
- ✅ CI runs automatically (6 jobs, 2-3 min)
- ✅ All checks pass
- ✅ Can merge after CI passes
- ✅ Can delete feature branch after merge

---

### 6. First Real Release (WHEN READY)

When you're ready to create your first release under new strategy:

```bash
# Merge develop to main
git checkout main
git merge develop --no-ff -m "chore: merge develop for v5.4.1 release"

# Update version
# Edit pyproject.toml: version = "5.4.1"

# Commit version bump
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v5.4.1"

# Tag release
git tag -a v5.4.1 -m "Release v5.4.1: CI/CD infrastructure and branching strategy"

# Push
git push origin main
git push origin v5.4.1

# GitHub Actions automatically creates release

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```
