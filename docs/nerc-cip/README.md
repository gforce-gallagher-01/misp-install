## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### When should we start implementation?
After all 3 team members complete their research (approx. 2 weeks from 2024-10-24).

### Can we implement in parallel?
Yes! Tasks are designed for parallel execution with minimal dependencies.

### What's the critical path?
Person 1 (Auth) ‚Üí Person 3 (SIEM) ‚Üí Person 3 (Incident Response)

### Do we need NERC approval?
No, these are self-certifying standards for Medium Impact systems.

### What about Low Impact?
Low Impact has reduced requirements. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

### Can we exclude any requirements?
No - all Medium Impact requirements are mandatory per NERC standards.

### How do we track progress?
Use the Production Readiness checklist and update compliance percentages weekly.
