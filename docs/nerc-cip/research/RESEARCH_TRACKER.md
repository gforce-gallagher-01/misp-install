## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| E-ISAC membership delays | Medium | High | Use ICS-CERT as alternative source | Person 2 |
| Azure AD access issues | Low | Medium | Fall back to LDAP | Person 1 |
| SIEM endpoint unavailable | Medium | High | Use local syslog as interim | Person 3 |
| Incomplete documentation | Low | Medium | Peer review process | All |
| Time overrun (>2 weeks) | Medium | Medium | Prioritize critical tasks | All |

### Escalation Process

**Level 1 - Blocker (self-resolve within 4 hours)**:
- Check documentation
- Ask team in Slack
- Search MISP forums

**Level 2 - Team Lead (escalate if blocked >4 hours)**:
- Notify team lead
- Request assistance
- Propose workaround

**Level 3 - Project Manager (escalate if blocked >1 day)**:
- Formal blocker report
- Resource request
- Timeline adjustment
