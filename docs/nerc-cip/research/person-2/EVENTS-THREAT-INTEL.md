# MISP NERC CIP Research Tasks - Person 2
## Events, Taxonomies, Feeds, Threat Intelligence

**Assigned To**: Person 2
**Focus Areas**: CIP-003 (Training), CIP-005 (ESP), CIP-013 (Supply Chain), CIP-015 (Monitoring)
**Estimated Total Time**: 25-30 hours
**Priority**: HIGH (Content foundation for compliance)
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

---

## Overview

You are responsible for researching and documenting **what threat intelligence content** should be in MISP, **how it should be organized** (taxonomies/tags), **where it comes from** (feeds), and **how events should be structured** for NERC CIP Medium Impact compliance.

**Why This Matters**:
- CIP-003 requires security awareness training - you'll define training content
- CIP-005 requires ESP monitoring - you'll define IOCs for firewalls
- CIP-013 requires supply chain tracking - you'll define vendor event structure
- CIP-015 requires internal monitoring - you'll define ICS threat intelligence

## Your Task List

### SECTION 1: EVENT TYPES & STRUCTURES (CIP-003, CIP-008)

**CIP Requirement**: Events must support training (CIP-003) and incident response (CIP-008)

**Current State**: Only 1 event exists (PIPEDREAM malware)

**Your Goal**: Define what types of events we need and how they should be structured

---

#### TASK 2.1: Define Required Event Categories

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours

**What to Research**:

1. **ICS/SCADA Attack Events**:
   - Historical attacks we should document for training

## Implementation Steps

1. **Enable existing taxonomies** (Person 1 can do this, or request admin access)
2. **Create custom NERC CIP taxonomy** (requires JSON file creation)
3. **Train team on tagging standards** (create quick reference guide)
4. **Audit existing event** (PIPEDREAM) - add missing tags
5. **Tag all future events** per guidelines

## WHO TO CONTACT FOR INFORMATION

**E-ISAC Membership**:
- Contact: _____________________________ (NERC CIP Compliance Officer or management)

**ICS Vendors**:
- Siemens contact: _____________________________
- Schneider contact: _____________________________
- GE contact: _____________________________

**Training Coordinator**:

- CISA ICS-CERT: https://www.cisa.gov/ics
- E-ISAC: https://www.eisac.com/

---

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Start with E-ISAC**: This is the most important feed - find out membership status ASAP
2. **Review the existing PIPEDREAM event**: It's a good example to follow
3. **Focus on ICS/SCADA**: Generic IT threats are lower priority than ICS-specific
4. **Tag Everything**: Proper tagging is critical for CIP compliance tracking
5. **Think Training**: Every event should be usable for CIP-003 R2 training

---

## PRIORITY ORDER

**If short on time, prioritize in this order**:
1. Task 2.3: Taxonomy Mapping (CRITICAL - can't classify events without this)
2. Task 2.4: Threat Feed Assessment (E-ISAC is critical for CIP-008)
3. Task 2.1: Event Categories (defines what we need to create)
4. Task 2.2: Event Templates (makes event creation consistent)
5. Task 2.5: Training Content (important but can be done later)

---

## QUESTIONS?

If you're stuck or need clarification:
1. Review the NERC CIP Audit Report: `docs/NERC_CIP_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
2. Check the NERC CIP Configuration Guide: `docs/NERC_CIP_CONFIGURATION.md`
3. Look at the existing PIPEDREAM event for structure examples
4. Ask the team lead or escalate to me for guidance

---

**Good luck with your research! Your work defines the content that makes MISP valuable.**

**Remember**: Quality over quantity - 5 well-structured events with good IOCs and tags are better than 20 poorly tagged events.
